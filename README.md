Coupon Acceptance Analysis
Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores customer behavior in relation to coupon acceptance. The analysis aims to identify key differences between customers who accepted the coupons and those who did not, providing insights into which factors most strongly influence acceptance.

Customer Demographics

Age: Younger customers had a higher rate of coupon acceptance compared to older customers.

Temperature and Time: Generally a customer is more likely to accept a coupon if the weather outside is warm and if the time is late morning to early afternoon.

Purchase Frequency: Customers who frequent the service of the advertised coupon tend to accept the coupon more often than those that don't.
